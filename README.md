# Carbon Emission Predictor (COâ‚‚)

Carbon emission calculator using Machine learning. This involves testing with a variety of models including Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Linear Regression, Support Vector Machines (SVM), Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, AdaBoost, and Decision Trees.

# Dependencies
You must have Python installed and the following libraries to view the project:
```
# Versions
- orange3:            3.37.0
- scikit-learn:        1.3.2
- PySide6:             6.7.2
- matplotlib:         3.9.1
- pandas:              2.2.2

```

# Build
When building your project into an executable using PyInstaller, include the DLL and version file in a folder named "bin". You can either place the "bin" folder inside your project's source directory. This ensures that the main.spec file correctly resolves its dependencies.

Welcome to the Carbon Emission Calculator !

Our tool is designed to help you estimate carbon emissions at construction sites across five key stages:

1. Production Stage (Emissions from raw material production)
2. Transportation to Factory (Emissions from transporting raw materials to factories)
3. Manufacturing (Emissions from the manufacturing process)
4. Transportation to the construction site (Emissions from transporting materials to the site)
5. Construction (Emissions from on-site construction activities)

By providing accurate insights into your carbon footprint at each stage, we empower you to make informed decisions for a more sustainable construction process.
